Create a view and run that on django server

include the app.urls path to urls.py of project folder


Setup React and front end to our project:
    django-admin startapp frontend
frontend will have anythong related to frontend

Create folder:
    static -  contain anything that the browser wil chache or anything static
        frontend - main javascript bundle
        css
        images
    templates

In parent frontend folder,
     npm init -y

install webpack to bundle al javascripts file:
    npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev

install babel to make our code browser friendly
    npm i @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react --save-dev
for async and await
    npm install @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties

install react
    npm i react react-dom --save-dev
reroute the pages
    npm install react-router-dom

install materials - to style webpage
    npm install @material-ui/core
    npm install @material-ui/icons

inside of parent frontend folder
    setup babel.config.json
    setup webpack.config.js
    inside src crate index.js


Django will render a page/templae that react will take contorl of.

setup index.html in child frontend folder inside templates
setup views.py in parent frontend folder
    to redicert requests to index.html for frontend

create urls.py for frontend, which will redirect by default to views.py> index method that we craeted above

Create App.js in frontend
    render coponent for ui

above chunk (Component created above) needs to be rendered in index.html, 
so that whatever we have in App.js will be in div of index.html
Access the app container in App.js -> const appDiv = document.getElementByID("app")
render()

entry file, index.js is importing '.components/App' which is App.js, rendering the code inside in index.html

Path : music_controller/frontend > npm run dev
    creates main.js inside child frontend folder which is simply the bundled javascript

go to settings.py and add frontend to installed apps

React router is used so that the components are viewed on different urls and not the default one

The routes added in react (App.js or home.js), they need to be added in Django urls.py as well

Added some js files to created and view rooms, imported in App.js
