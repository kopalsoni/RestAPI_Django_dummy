Folders:


In terminal:
django-admin startproject <name of the project>

cd <name of the project>
django-admin startapp <app name/ api>
        .init.py - to make the folder a python package
        models.py - this is wehre our database models are gonna gonna
        tests.py - if you're gonna put tests
        views.py - code for rendering our use or API endpoints

Now we need to add 
1. our app created above to the project
2. 'rest_framework'
    go to project folder > settings.py > Installations = [] > add '<app name created above>.apps.ApiConfig'
                                                            add 'rest_framework'
    Note: ApiConfig is actually a class that was created in apps.py file under <app name> folder

create urls.py under app folder - to store the urls local to the app. They're essentially the endpoints


Whenever make a change in model or database, run below command to push
Terminal:
    python .\manage.py makemigrations
    python .\manage.py migrate

Run the web server:
    python .\manage.py runserver

serializers.py = translate our class in models to json response to setup an API view for backend
